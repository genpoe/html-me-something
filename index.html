                    <h2>London</h2>
                    <p>We spent the first two weeks, the bulk of the program, in London, England. I've been incredibly fortunate
                        to travel a lot because of my dad's job, so this was my third time visiting London, and it was by far my
                        favorite place I had ever traveled.

                    <p>On our way up to Scotland, we stopped at many places, but Fountains Abbey was by far my favorite. We
                        were allowed to fully interact with the ruins, instead of admiring from a distance like Stonehenge.
