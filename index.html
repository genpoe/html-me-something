                    <p>We spent the first two weeks, the bulk of the program, in London, England. I've been incredibly fortunate
                        to travel a lot because of my dad's job, so this was my third time visiting London, and it was by far my
                        favorite place I had ever traveled before. We went to plays, museums, and lots of street markets. What I
                        remember most of all, though, is all of the food from the amazing restaurants we went to.

                    <h2>Fountains Abbey</h2>
                    <figure><img src="Images/fountains-abbey.jpg"></figure>
                    <p>On our way up to Scotland, we stopped at many places, but Fountains Abbey was by far my favorite. We
                        were allowed to fully interact with the ruins, instead of admiring from a distance like Stonehenge. I may have
                        climbed through a window. It had rained all morning, so by the time we got back to the bus, my shoes and socks
                        were completely soaked through and covered in mud. I bought new socks in the next town we stopped at just so I
                        could dry off my feet at least a bit. They didn't sell any rain boots because, and I quote, "it's not the rainy
                        season." It was literally raining as she said this.

                    <h2>Edinburgh</h2>
                    <figure><img src="Images/edinburgh-1.jpg"></figure>
                    <p>Remember how I said London WAS my favorite place I had ever traveled? It was replaced by Edinburgh within
                        a day. I don't love London any less than I did before, Edinburgh is just such an incredible city. While what
                        I remember about London was the food, what I remember most about Edinburgh is the atmosphere (okay, and the
                        food, too). Despite being such a big city, everyone was so kind and would truly go out of their way to help
                        a bunch of clueless American college students.

                    <h2>The Highlands</h2>
                    <figure><img src="Images/Highlands.jpg"></figure>
                    <p>Despite being Kansas born-and-bred, I thought I was pretty accustomed to mountains, having spent many summers
                        in Colorado as a kid. I was NOT PREPARED for the Highlands. Quite possibly the most beautiful place on Earth.
                        Words and pictures from my lackluster phone camera do it no justice. We took a three-day circle around the
                        Highlands, starting and ending in Edinburgh, and going all the way up to the Isle of Skye. Other than that,
                        there was no "planned" itenerary. The guide had places he recommended stopping, but any time we saw somewhere
                        that looked interesting, all we had to do was shout and he'd pull over for us to explore. Every bit of it was
                        incredible, but I could have spent all days just staring at these mountains.

                    <h2>Back to Edinburgh</h2>
                    <figure><img src="Images/Edinburgh-2.jpg"></figure>
                    <p>After our trip around the Highlands, we spent another week in Edinburgh before heading back Stateside. Like
                        London, lots of museums, lots of restaurants (we didn't have a kitchen in our dorm, okay?), and lots of
                        exploring. Probably the best food I had was at Kismot, and Indian and Bangladeshi restaurant. They're home to the
                        "Kismot Killer", a curry so spicy you have to sign a waver before they'll serve it to you. Our professor
                        explicitly banned us from trying it. It has been known to hospitalize people before.
